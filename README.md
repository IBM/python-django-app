# Create and deploy a Python Django application

> We have applications available for [Node.js Express](https://github.com/IBM/node-express-app), [Go Gin](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app), [Python Django](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-app), [Swift Kitura](https://github.com/IBM/swift-kitura-app), [Android](https://github.com/IBM/android-app), and [iOS](https://github.com/IBM/ios-app).

In this sample application, you will create a web application using Django to serve web pages in Python, complete with standard best practices, including a health check.

This app contains an opinionated set of files for web serving:

- `app/templates/index.html`
- `staticfiles/js/bundle.js`
- `staticfiles/css/default.css`

## Steps

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Running Django applications has been simplified with a `manage.py` file to avoid dealing with configuring environment variables to run your app. From your project root, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
pipenv install
```

Then, activate this app's virtualenv:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

To run your application locally, run this inside the virtualenv:

```bash
python manage.py start
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.  You can access the `/health` endpoint at the host. You can also verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

##### Debugging locally
To debug a `django` project run `python manage.py runserver` with DEBUG set to True in `settings.py` to start a native django development server. This comes with the Django's stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces. For more information, see [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/).

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Kubernetes, run one of the commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
